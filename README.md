ToDo App ~

The ToDO app is an app buiilt for listing items that I plan on executing given set time frame. Has the ability to add as many items as needed, as well as cross off all items done.

Tic-Tac-Toe Game ~
The infamous tic-tac-toe game I created has a twist to it, instead of using the typical 'X's and 'O's my version was given a spinoff with, a sporty twist!

Calculator ~
This is your basic, fully functioning calculator, designed with the big three web development languages, HTML, CSS, and of course JavaScript.

Restaurant Menu ~
This web site is a functioning page that informs the user of the options available while adding the cost in real time, so customers are aware of transaction amount ASAP.
